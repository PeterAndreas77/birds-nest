# Goal & Use Case

This is a simple travel diary app for people who love to travel. People can share their stories with others.

My family love to travel and we would take pictures to capture our memories. Most of the times my colleagues or relatives asked how the trip was, and It was such a hassle to tell them about our trip. So, I wanted to create an app to post our stories so others can see it.
